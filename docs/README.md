# Audit Service Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Audit Service.

## Structure

*   **[Evolution](evolution/README.md)**: Tracks the history, roadmap, and version milestones of the project.
*   **[Decisions](decisions/README.md)**: Explanations of broader technical choices and strategies (e.g., "Why Python?", "How do I index?").
*   **[ADRs](adrs/README.md)**: Formal **Architecture Decision Records**. These are immutable records of specific architectural choices (e.g., "Use Postgres RLS").

## Quick Links

*   **[Root README](../README.md)**: Setup and installation instructions.
*   **[API Docs](../app/main.py)**: See `main.py` for entry points (or run the app and visit `/docs`).
