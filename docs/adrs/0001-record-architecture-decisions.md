# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-12-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need to record architectural decisions made in this project to provide my audience with a deeper understanding of my reasoning and how it can help them implement or use this system.

## Decision

I will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. I will follow a lightweight format including Context, Decision, and Consequences.

## Consequences

*   **Positive:** Clear history of decisions, easier onboarding, better understanding of trade-offs.
*   **Negative:** Requires discipline to write and maintain.
